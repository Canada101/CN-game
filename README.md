# CN-Online Messaging Application
This project is aimed to test our implementation of concepts learned in the Computer Networks class. This project implements flask and sockets to create an application that allows users to create a chat room and share messages and files between each other on the smae network. The frontend of the applicaiton was designed using html. The backed is designed using python. The required libraries to run this code are python, os, shutil, flask, flask socketio, and atexit. This application relies on the test server produced by the host running the application. The server may not be accessible if the network router that the users are connected to contains a firewall restricting the access to port 5000. Once the repository has been cloned the program can be ran by executing the following command in terminal python app.py.
